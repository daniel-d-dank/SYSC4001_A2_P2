The fork system call is used to create a new process by duplicating some other process. Specifically, when some process calls fork,
its process image and PCB entry are copied byte-by-byte to produce a new process. The PCB entries for the original (parent) and new (child)
processes are changed minimally: the child process has a distinct PID from the parent; the child process has its memory address location
updated to point to the new process image, rather than the original (the parent’s); and both the parent and child process’s entries are
given pointers to each other (their child or parent process, respectively). Note that the two processes are also scheduled independently,
since they are distinct processes.

When the fork command returns, the behavior differs depending on whether the process is the original (parent) process or the new (child)
process. The parent process’s fork command will return with the PID of the child process that was produced by the fork; if the parent
returns a negative value, then the fork has failed. However, the child process’s fork command will return with a value of 0. This is
significant, as the parent and child processes share the same code; the return value of fork can be used by programmers in order to
determine whether the currently-running process is the parent or child process.
